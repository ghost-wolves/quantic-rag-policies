{"id": "q11", "question": "What does the incident response material say about containment?", "answer": "The incident response material outlines containment as a critical step in managing cybersecurity incidents. It involves implementing initial short-term mechanisms to prevent further damage and reduce the immediate impact of the incident, typically by removing the adversary's access. The specific containment strategy used will depend on the type of incident and the systems affected. Key activities include isolating affected assets, which can involve perimeter containment, internal network containment, and host-based/endpoint containment. Additionally, it may require temporarily disconnecting public-facing systems from the internet, assessing risks to other systems, and applying interim mitigations. The containment strategy should also consider the need to preserve evidence, service accountability, resource constraints, and the time required for containment steps.\n\nCitations: [C1], [C3], [C4]", "grounded": 1, "citation_accurate": 1, "notes": "Keyword overlap score=0.615 (heuristic)."}
{"id": "q12", "question": "What does the incident response material say about eradication or recovery?", "answer": "The incident response material states that once eradication is successful, the incident response can move into Recovery. During Recovery, systems are restored to normal operations, and it is confirmed that they are functioning at baseline levels. Key components of Recovery include having mechanisms and controls in place to validate the successful execution of the recovery plan and ensuring no signs of adversary presence remain in the environment. The specific recovery activities may vary depending on the type of incident and affected systems, but common strategies include reconnecting rebuilt or new systems to networks, tightening perimeter security, and fully patching and installing updates on all systems before reconnecting to the network. Additionally, it is important to change all local system and user passwords on affected systems before redeployment [C1], [C2], [C3], [C4].\n\nCitations: [C1], [C2], [C3], [C4]", "grounded": 1, "citation_accurate": 1, "notes": "Keyword overlap score=0.681 (heuristic)."}

It must not be emailed as attachments; instead, approved secure sharing mechanisms should be used. Secrets such as API keys and tokens must never be committed to Git and should utilize environment variables or a secrets manager [C1].\n\n2. **Email Security**:\n   - Sensitive data should not be sent unencrypted via email. If email is necessary, encryption technology should be used to protect the transmission, which may include VPN, SSL, or message encryption [C3].\n\n3. **General Data Protection**:\n   - Know the sensitivity of the data stored on your computer and the applicable policies. Password protection or encryption of sensitive data is recommended. Regular backups of local data should be conducted, and these backups must be secured with the same level of security as the original data [C5].\n\n4. **Compliance**:\n   - Compliance with relevant policies, procedures, and applicable laws is mandatory, and the more stringent standard should be followed regardless of the location of the device or the ownership of the device used to access or store sensitive data [C4].\n\nCitations: [C1], [C3], [C4], [C5]", "grounded": 1, "citation_accurate": 1, "notes": "Keyword overlap score=0.806 (heuristic)."}
